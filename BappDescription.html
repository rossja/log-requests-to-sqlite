<p>This extension keeps a trace of every HTTP request that has been sent via BURP, in an SQLite database.
This is useful for keeping a record of exactly what traffic a pen tester has generated.</p>

<p>The database is created as <i>LogRequestsToSQLite.db</i> in your home directory.</p>

<p>There are two configuration options in the menu bar:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Log only requests from defined target scope</li>
    <li>Exclude image resource requests</li>
</ul>
